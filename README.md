## What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.[2] It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. Ansible was written by Michael DeHaan and acquired by Red Hat in 2015. Ansible is agentless, temporarily connecting remotely via SSH or Windows Remote Management (allowing remote PowerShell execution) to do its tasks. 


# Ansible-Pros-and-Cons
Obviously, every device has ideal use cases in which it sparkles more splendid than the rest. For instance, Ansible is broadly viewed as being anything but difficult to learn and utilize its Playbooks are comprehensible/justifiable, taking into account results to be accomplished in a shorter measure of time. All things considered, the contribution's effortlessness may leave progressed clients wanting more advancement. 

Pros :



1. Straightforward:

This is maybe Ansible's most praised trait: clients can find a good pace and profitable rapidly with the apparatus. Upheld by clear, simple to-follow documentation, one can become familiar with the work process and rationale of Ansible's tasks in a short measure of time. An absence of a reliance framework implies Ansible errands simply run successively and stop when a mistake is experienced. This makes investigating simpler, particularly when at first beginning with the instrument.

2. Agent less :

For overseeing hubs, Ansible handles all ace/operator correspondences with standard SSH or the Paramiko module, which is a Python execution of the SSH2. The instrument doesn't need any specialists to be introduced on distant frameworks to be overseen, which implies less upkeep overhead and execution debasements. Look at our interpretation of why agent less was the best approach for Guard Rail.

3.Effectively Understandable Python Language :

One of the unmistakable focal points of Ansible likewise alludes to the language where it is composed. Python is a comprehensible language and fills in as the reason for Ansible. It gives better offices to getting up Ansible and running it because of the nearness of Python libraries on most of Linux appropriations of course.  

Python is an exceptionally ideal option for organization and scripting errands suggesting higher ubiquity among archiects and framework heads. Another intriguing part of Ansible is the office of Ansible modules that can improve its usefulness. The Ansible modules can be written in any language. Notwithstanding, the significant worry, for this situation, is that the module should return information in JSON design.

4.Playbooks are written in YAML :

The utilization of Playbooks in Ansible is additionally another purpose behind the significant points of interest of Ansible. Playbooks are Ansible design documents, and the language for thinking of them is YAML. The fascinating element, for this situation, is that YAML is a superior option for setup the executives and mechanization.  

The prevalence of YAML over different arrangements like JSON improves Ansible design the executives and robotization apparatus. Ansible makes it simple to peruse and underpins remarks. Generally significant of all, it additionally incorporates the utilization of stays to reference different things.

5. Ansible Galaxy:

This entrance fills in as the focal archive for discovering, reusing, and sharing Ansible substance. For instance, reusable Roles for worker design or application establishment can be downloaded for use in one's playbooks, essentially quickening organization time.

Cons:



1.Inadequate User Interface:

 The principal section in the disservices of Ansible is the unrefined UI. Ansible was at first an order line just device. The main exertion of Ansible at making a UI was with AWX graphical UI. The other part in the UI was the REST endpoint that is intended for simpler framework the executives.  

Consequently, the transformed into the Ansible Tower, which is a web the board UI. Ansible Tower offers visual administration highlights and a group based work process instrument. In any case, the Ansible Tower requires significant enhancements. For instance, practically 85% of undertakings that could be finished through the order line can be accomplished through the UI.  

You could likewise run over another notice of Ansible hindrances emerging from its UI. The disappointment of synchronization between the GUI and the order line can prompt clashing inquiry results. On an overall premise, Ansible Tower is still in the improvement organizes and couldn't do everything like an order line interface.

2. Absence of any Notion of State:

Not at all like practically identical computerization apparatuses like Puppet, Ansible has no thought of state. Since it doesn't monitor conditions, the device just executes a consecutive arrangement of assignments, halting when it completes, falls flat or experiences a blunder. For a few, this oversimplified method of robotization is attractive; nonetheless, many favor their mechanization apparatus to keep up a broad list for requesting , permitting them to arrive at a characterized state paying little mind to any change in natural conditions.

3.Beginning Windows Support:

The following unmistakable notice among Ansible drawbacks is the half-manufactured Windows uphold. Ansible adaptation 1.7 backings Windows just as Linux/Unix hubs. On account of Windows, Ansible utilizes a local Power Shell remoting instead of SSH. Subsequently, a Linux control machine is compulsory for the administration of Windows has. The restricted help for Windows in Ansible presents one of the imposing mishaps with the arrangement the executives and robotization apparatus.

4.Insignificant Enterprise Support Experience:

The absence of big business uphold experience additionally draws down the intrigue of Ansible. Ansible doesn't have an undeniable working involvement in huge endeavors like its rivals, for example, Puppet and Chef. Despite the fact that Ansible cases the office of big business grade broadened uphold choices, restricted pragmatic experience lessens the responsibility of Ansible.

5. Ansible is New:

Ansible hasn't been around insofar as contending arrangements like Chef or Puppet; therefore, it has the littlest designer/client network and has minimal materials on the web for self improvement and investigating. Less time available implies that specific hazardous edge situations, bugs, and programming issues have maybe yet to become known. Contingent upon the utilization case within reach, this can either be an obstruction or preferred position.


Advantages of Ansible
With so many simplifications, Ansible can surely present many advantages. Let us have a closer look!

Simple to Learn
The foremost mention among advantages of Ansible refers to its simplicity. The simplicity is not only meant for professionals but also for beginners. It is easy to learn, and so, users could learn to use Ansible quickly along with better productivity. Ansible receives the support of comprehensive and easily interpretable documentation.

Therefore, you can learn the logic of Ansible operations and the workflow in a limited period. The lack of a dependency system could imply that Ansible tasks execute sequentially and stop when identifying an error. As a result, troubleshooting becomes a lot easier, even in the initial stages of learning about ansible.

Easily Understandable Python Language
One of the prominent advantages of Ansible also refers to the language in which it is written. Python is a human-readable language and serves as the basis for Ansible. It provides better facilities for getting up Ansible and running it due to the presence of Python libraries on the majority of Linux distributions by default.

Python is a highly ideal alternative for administration and scripting tasks implying higher popularity among engineers and system administrators. Another interesting aspect of Ansible is the facility of Ansible modules that can improve its functionality. The Ansible modules can be written in any language. However, the important concern, in this case, is that the module should return data in JSON format.

No Dependency on Agents
The next important addition among the benefits of Ansible refers to its agentless nature. Ansible manages all the master-agent communications through Standard SSH or Paramiko module. The Paramiko module is a Python implementation of SSH2 and is crucial for managing nodes. Therefore, Ansible does not require any form of agents installed on remote systems for ensuring management. As a result, maintenance overheads and performance degradations reduce considerably by huge margins with Ansible.

Playbooks are written in YAML
The use of Playbooks in Ansible is also another reason for the major advantages of Ansible. Playbooks are Ansible configuration files, and the language for writing them is YAML. The interesting factor, in this case, is that YAML is a better alternative for configuration management and automation.

The superiority of YAML over other formats like JSON makes Ansible better configuration management and automation tool. Ansible makes it easy to read and supports comments. Most important of all, it also includes the use of anchors to reference other items.

Ansible Galaxy
Another notable entry among advantages of Ansible refers to the Ansible Galaxy. Ansible Galaxy is a portal that acts as the central repository for locating, reusing, and sharing Ansible-related content. The best advantage of Ansible Galaxy is in the example of downloading reusable Roles for installing application or server configuration. The downloads are ideal for use in a particular userâ€™s playbooks and can contribute substantially to an increase in deployment speed.

To be proficient with Ansible, one must be familiar with the Ansible modules. Here is the list of top Ansible Modules that you should learn.

Disadvantages of Ansible
After a clear reflection on different advantages of Ansible, let us focus on the setbacks you can encounter with it.

Insufficient User Interface
The first entry in the disadvantages of Ansible is the crude user interface. Ansible was initially a command-line only tool. The first effort of Ansible at making a user interface was with AWX graphical user interface. The other component in the UI was the REST endpoint that is meant for easier infrastructure management.

Subsequently, the AWX turned into the Ansible Tower, which is a web management UI. Ansible Tower offers visual management features and a team-based workflow instrument. However, the Ansible Tower requires considerable improvements. For example, almost 85% of tasks that could be completed through the command line can be achieved through the UI.

You could also come across another mention of Ansible disadvantages arising from its UI. The failure of synchronization between the GUI and the command line can lead to conflicting query results. On a general basis, Ansible Tower is still in the development stages and could not do everything like a command-line interface.

Lack of any Notion of State
Another prominent mention among the disadvantages of Ansible is the lack of any notion of state. Ansible does not have any notion of state like other automation tools such as Puppet. Ansible does not track dependencies and simply executes sequential tasks and stops when tasks finish, fail, or any error comes.

These traits are not ideal for users who want the automation tool to maintain a detailed catalog for ordering. The catalog can help in reaching a specific state without any influence of changes in environmental conditions. However, Ansible lacks it and presents a formidable disadvantage.

Limited Windows Support
The next prominent mention among Ansible disadvantages is the half-built Windows support. Ansible version 1.7 supports Windows as well as Linux/Unix nodes. In the case of Windows, Ansible employs a native PowerShell remoting rather than SSH. As a result, a Linux control machine is mandatory for the management of Windows hosts. The limited support for Windows in Ansible presents one of the formidable setbacks with the configuration management and automation tool.

Ansible does not have Experience
The lack of enterprise support experience also draws down the appeal of Ansible. Ansible does not have a full-fledged working experience with large enterprises like its competitors, such as Puppet and Chef. Even though Ansible claims the facility of enterprise-grade extended support options, limited practical experience reduces the accountability of Ansible.

Ansible is New to the Market
Finally, you can note one of the most common entries in Ansible advantages and disadvantages as a prominent setback of Ansible. Ansible is new to the market, unlike its renowned competitors. As a result, it does not have a large developer or user community. Furthermore, the new presence of Ansible on the market implies the possibilities of undiscovered bugs, software issues, and edge scenarios.
